Once he return to his senses, he would stare at his wounded arm and his terrified mom. When he was older, Ezekiel was getting rid of demons when he got into an argument with a bigger priest of Lua. He went berserk, just like any other day. Ezekiel was alone when he came to, and he was taken aback by the bond on his cursed arm. When he tried to take it off, he found that the priest's magic couldn't be shaken off so easily. However, he stopped going berserk and losing his consciousness after that. He's gained greater control over his mana, so it's now one of his most treasured items."

However, those who know a thing or two about clothing will never fail to bring up Yuria's name. Yuria, a tailor from Penteonia, always has two conditions that she sets when accepting requests. First, the client needs to allow Yuria to spend some time with the client so that she draws inspiration as to what kind of clothing she would make. Second, while she is with the client, the client must not lie or pretend to be something they are not. The first condition is for her sense of 'Foresight.' She needs to feel the client's thread of fate so she can express it through clothing. The second condition is mainly because she can sense the truth and finds lies disgusting. She doesn't want to make anything for anyone who won't be true. Her masterpieces, made with the fate she's read, are as valuable as starlight. Even the nobles would be envious of them.",

There were strange creatures flying around her, and they were creating a strange atmosphere that made Lavril feel difficult to approach. The fortune teller sensed her presence and welcomed her. - Welcome to Stardust Fortune Teller's Tent. What do you wish to know? Looking at the fortune teller smile, Lavril timidly opened her mouth. - W-we... we want to make a friend. A friend who is different than us... A friend who breathes, who we can touch... Wh-where could we meet a friend like that...? The fortune teller handed her a card, smiling. On the card that the moon was engraved on, there was a powerful creature drawn on the surface. It was the creature that Lavril feared. Lavril tried to put the card down instantly out of visceral fear, But she then felt the creature accepting her touch, as if relieving her anxiety. Lavril was surprised for a moment, but soon felt at ease. Then, the fortune teller put her hands on Lavril's. - You don't have to look far. Aren't we already good friends? Finishing her sentence, the fortune teller started moving cards, one by one, still holding Lavril's hands. The cards were telling things to the fortune teller in silence, as if they wanted to make Lavril's desperate wish come true. Soon, the cards were all laid out in order and the fortune teller opened her mouth, smiling. - These boys and girls seem to like you very much. They are telling me that you're going to meet countless people that you will hold dear. Before long, you will meet the friends that you've been waiting for."

She wanted to go inside the village and make some friends, but the recent memory of being driven away by the priests of Lua kept her from doing so. Just then, she heard a joyful singing near the flowerbeds just outside the village. Curious, she slowly moved toward where the voice was coming from. A girl was singing and playing the harp among the full-blown flowers, and the children, animals, even fairies were dancing to her song. Mesmerized by the scene, she was walking toward the flowerbeds before she knew it. The moment she set her foot in the flowerbeds, fairies and animals started to shriek and hide, and children burst into tears. They were very sensitive to energy, and they felt threatened by Lavril's presence. The girl, however, reacted in a completely different way. She calmed the creatures down, picked a few flowers around her, and handed them to Lavril. Holding the flowers, Lavril gave a blissful smile out of the feeling of acceptance. Then, animals, fairies, and children all started to greet her merrily, having realized Lavril would not harm them."

The Saint of Blessings Lucias and the maverick Baudouin were among the ones that answered the call. Upon hearing about Lavril, the two hurriedly tracked her down and confronted her. As soon as they saw her, they realized that she was not an ordinary ghost, but an amalgamation of child ghosts. It didn't take long before they knew she wasn't a threat. However, the Church had spoken. Ghosts are to be exorcized, and as priests, they were supposed to cleanse her and guide her to where she belonged. But Lucias had a different idea. Lavril was a pure soul that did not deserve an exorcism, and he wanted to let her proceed to the next realm when the time comes, following the law of nature. Lucias took out his handkerchief, wiped the tears off Lavril's face, and showed her the path to the light with the teachings of Lua. This handkerchief reminds her of Lucias, the light that guides her when she is in trouble."

They are jealous of the living, and openly exhibit aggression to turn the living into new Evil Spirits like them. Lavril, however, is made of the juvenile innocence of children. It is an exception that is too pure to be called an Evil Spirit. A strange entity whose existence seems ironic. It is haunted by loneliness, even when it is full of countless souls. When she was first awakened in this land, she did not know who or what she was. Only pain and suffering dominated her body, and she lacked a clear purpose. The sorrow from the young souls who had met a painful demise began to form tears, and the exploding powers of the souls called out to other Evil Spirits. They say the vast sky was completely darkened when Lavril was born. Having heard her terrible cries, the first to arrive was Spiritual Guide Rephy. Learning about Lavril's plight from other souls, he was able to locate her with help from Oddy and Nyx. Rephy offered her many different gifts to stop her from crying, and this is what caught her eyes the most. This is a type of precious jewel left behind by vengeful Evil Spirits when they are banished. It is the last trace of a unshackled soul who has finally found freedom from evil. This jewel is believed to have soothed Lavril's deep sorrow."

The goal of this experiment was to transform them into crimson arcane crystal living mines - that would mass produce crimson arcane crystals until the moment they die. Pain from the inhumane experiment took its toll on the children and one by one, losing their lives. Children who weren't compatible with the crimson arcane crystal were petrified and crumbled into dust. The remaining children who witnessed this horror were shaking with fear, and hopelessly awaited their death. But the experiment finally came to a success. Crimson arcane crystals resonated with Kirze, and she absorbed all the crystals in the area. As a result, she gained vast amount of mana and gained ability to manipulate crimson arcane crystals at her will.

    "story": "Born in a noble family in Penteonia, Bernheim von Lachelima was gifted with outstanding martial skills. He had the strength of a giant and excellent judgment, so it was undeniable that he would make a great knight. However, he had a fatal flaw that kept him from being successful in Penteonia: He could not use the power of light at all. No matter how hard he tried, how strong his faith and will were, the power of light did not answer to his calling. Although all he ever wanted was to serve his nation and the Queen, the fact that his incapability was keeping him from being more than a low-level knight frustrated him. Bernheim did not give up and trained hard to handle the power of light, but his constant lack of progress slowly started to weaken his mind. One day, he visited the Central Church to study the power of light and its mechanism. It was when he was quietly reading a book that he heard a sound. It was an angelic voice calling for him. The long-accumulated frustration of Bernheim led him to where the voice was coming from, a room sealed with multiple magic barriers in the basement of the church. As he moved closer to it, the barriers vanished as if they were never there. What he saw inside the room was a sword in the shape of an angel, exuding blinding light. 'You are the chosen one', said the sword, drawing him near with holy light. Thinking that his relentless effort had finally paid off, he slowly grasped the sword. Then, his mind was drawn into the deepest darkness. The darkness that captured him—it was the endless shadowy void of futility. A vessel that could never be filled; a whole other universe. In the vast darkness, Bernheim felt his mind deteriorating and his existence fading away. His mind and body was slowly being encroached by a dark, ominous power. However, Bernheim was also one of the Penteonian Knights, a Knight of Light who swore not to be defeated by darkness. He rose from the shrouding darkness, regaining consciousness with his indomitable spirit. When he came to his senses, lying on the floor, there was a giant black sword in his hand. The demonic sword with the appearance of a demon was laughing and mocking the knight who broke away from the path of light. Eventually, Bernheim was banished from Penteonia, and he started to live a new life as a mercenary in Vespia Empire with that malicious, foul-mouthed demonic sword in his hand...",

However, Glenwys, a 16-year-old commoner girl who had no strings to pull, won the tournament 4 years ago and the noble purpose of the competition was regained. On the day of her victory, the Colosseum was filled with thundering applause of the audience who were longing to see haughty aristocrats lose what they thought belonged to them. Glenwys became a new idol of the Empire, and people were buying gifts for her. Glenwys, however, had to turn down all the gifts. Not only was the national attention too much for her, but she also knew that those with power would never take joy in seeing commoners rally around a hero like her. Nevertheless, she could not say no to a timid little girl that came holding a paperweight made of dandelions in her small hands, and it became the only present that she kept for herself."

On the day that she became the winner of 3 consecutive tournaments, the 'Ballas Ruby,' a jewel of a knight, was delivered to her, which became the last gesture of support she ever got from the nameless helper.

The third championship match was the last tournament match in which Glenwys fought in. Her last opponent was a mysterious man with a mask who defeated all his opponents throughout the tournament in less than a few seconds. Glenwys was nervous when she saw him fight in the semi-final match. As expected, the fight was one-sided. A man swung a pair of red swords at Glenwys like a red storm. She waited for an opportunity while blocking his fierce attacks. The man finally seemed to let his guard down, and Glenwys launched a powerful strike. But to her surprise, the man dodged it simply by taking a few steps back. However, the explosion caused by Glenwys's attack made the man's mask crack, revealing his handsome face. She then saw, through the breaking mask, that the man was smiling. Noticing that her attack didn't leave a scratch on him, Glenwys raised her shield up again, appalled, but the man suddenly threw the towel. Soon, the smoke around the two people cleared, and there was another mask on the man's face. Shocked and astonished, Glenwys could not understand what had happened until the Emperor handed her the trophy, until she saw the man standing behind the Emperor with the Royal Guard Captain, giving her a warm applause."

The old, eroded statue was holding the halberd firmly in its hands, as if showing its determination to protect the labyrinth against intruders. Loman, who was in charge of the labyrinth excavation, felt something indescribably sublime from the statue and showed due courtesy in front of it. At that moment, the statue dropped its halberd to the ground and began to crumble away. The halberd itself seemed unaffected by time and was imbued with a mysterious energy. 'That statue suddenly crumbled and dropped the halberd...' Scarlet said, glancing over the report. 'Yes, ma'am.' Scarlet then gazed at Loman. 'The unyielding sincerity of protecting a place until his very body collapses... I know a man like that.' 'Pardon, ma'am?' He looked at Scarlet with a puzzled face as she handed over the halberd, smiling."

She was staring at the broken mace when she turned her eyes to the prisoners. Her eyes stopped at the Hell Beast Hartnon whose entire body was covered with horns. A cruel grin appeared on her face. - You! You've got a pretty eyeball for a piece of trash! In time, the monster's eye went through Blacksmith Jin's hands and became Nicky's new mace. The new mace was perfect for her. The horns sprouting from the mace exuded an excruciating curse, while the deep grudge ingrained in the monster's iris offering ensured a soul-crushing pain. The inmates began to call the new mace 'Hartnon' in remembrance of the beast sacrificed for the weapon.

    "story": "Hanus was only 13 when the Guild Allied Forces recruited her. She is known as the legendary girl who was also called as the little giantess of the battlefield. As the daughter of the guild master of a weapon guild, Hanus used to play with discarded firearms and blades when she was young. This is when the others discovered her ingenuity in arms. The Guild Alliance decided that they cannot allow such profound talent to go to waste. The Alliance, after barely managing to convince Hanus' father who fiercely disagreed with the Alliance's decision, recruited her. Hanus was trained along with other soldiers, and just as the Guild had expected, she displaced her talent on battlefield. Hanus' revolutionary weapons were ridiculously strong enough to shift the paradigm of warfare. Her craftmanship, combined with her masterful tactics, marked the birth of an ultimate soldier of the Allied Forces. Moreover, Hanus herself vastly enjoyed her life in the army, as she could utilize her handcrafted weapons to their fullest. However, great talent meant more demands and battles to fight. During an operation, Hanus ended up being wounded. Upon hearing this news about her daughter's injury, Hanus' father who detested seeing his daughter in the army ever since the early days, raised his voice against the Alliance, and strongly demanded her daughter to be discharged from service at once. However, as people say, no parents are strong enough to bend their child's will. Hanus, who would rather die than be discharged from service, persistently persuaded her father. In the end, she managed to get her father's approval, under the condition that she stays in the military only as an instructor that doesn't participate in battles. Currently, Hanus thinks that her life as an instructor is not too bad at all, but deep inside, she still yearns to return to battlefields. Inside the Command Center, she silently awaits for the day when she will finally stand on the battlefield with comrades whom she taught.",

She uses this weapon against a target who makes her angry. This deadly weapon named Hanus Type-0 is loaded with special bullets that corrodes the target's body upon hit. Not only that, this weapon also fires a tracking bullet now and then, making it impossible for a target to escape Hanus. If anyone could create this intricate firearm other than Hanus, perhaps it would be geniuses such as the head researcher of Magos Le'Flamme, or the one regarded as the famous genius technomagi of Orvel. The story behind the creation of this weapon is an interesting tale to tell. In the past, when Hanus was achieving much with her feat, she was assigned to a smuggler elimination operation. During the mission, the ringleader of the smuggling connection insulted Hanus whilst escaping the scene: 'The children's playground is over there. You should go and play a war game with your friends instead.' Enraged to the max, Hanus fought with everything she had, but Hanus had to retreat due to the sheer number of bodyguards protecting the ringleader. Hanus was enraged for days over the fact that she had allowed the criminal who insulted her to escape right in front of her. Then, on the day of the follow-up operation to eliminate the smuggling connection, Hanus brought this strange gun to the mission. On that very day, one shot from her gun concluded the elimination operation. As she shot her gun, she said to herself: 'It's play time.'"

Amidst the hardships however, there was one person who recognized Hanus' ability for the first time. Starting from then, as time went by, more and more soldiers started to recognize Hanus as their comrades, or even something more than that. To Hanus, this person was someone precious, and grateful. However, their friendship came to a temporary halt when Hanus had to change position within the army. Seeing Hanus cry for the first time, this comrade smiled gently and gave her hat to Hanus which she had worn in battles as a token of friendship and respect.

While playing with blades and firearms, she remembered her father's big gun which was kept inside her father's room. Hanus' father once told her that despite its great firepower, the gun was ultimately deemed unsuitable for combat due to its massive weight. When Hanus saw the gun however, she felt that the gun could be modified appropriately. After contemplating for some time, she sneaked the gun from her father's room. After a few days, the gun was successfully modified into a tiny gun that fits Hanus. Hanus' father scolded her harshly for touching his gun without permission, but he could not hide his surprise when he saw the modified gun. Even though the gun's weight had been dramatically decreased, its firepower remained the same. After seeing this insane weapon, Hanus' father felt that her daughter's craftmanship is something extraordinary. Even more amazing is the fact that all this took place when Hanus was just 5 years old."
