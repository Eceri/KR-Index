He was once a stout monarch whom no one dared to cross. However, he, too, began to show weakness with age. When he finally fell ill, those with aspirations of power began gathering around him like flies. Scarlet tried her hardest to protect her father in this chaos. But the man being swayed by the flatterers around him was no longer the respected king she once knew. The king turned his back on his daughter's pleas. The nobles were unhappy to accept her, the king's only child, as the next queen, to say the least. The atmosphere of the royal palace darkened quickly. She knows. The nobles would pressure her incessantly. But she would never yield. She is prepared to fight to protect her kingdom, to protect her people. She would never let those who are greedy for power to take control of the kingdom. No matter what...","itemIntroductions":{"weapon":"The most legendary sword in Orvelia. This sacred blade has been passed down the royal lineage of Orvelia since the kingdom's birth, symbolizing the true authority of the monarch. King Kyle used this sword as well, until he was chosen by the Holy Sword Aea. Blessed with the power of light, its blade can disable any magic by cutting through its flow. Only a knight of noble bloodline and righteous pride can wield this sword. Those who wish to lift it must pass the trial of the royal family, a feat only accomplished by Scarlet, aside from Kyle.","treasures":["A gauntlet made by rare, high-density ores found in the Ziltrion family's mine. It is what Scarlet received from Demia when they exchanged gifts after completing the final part of their swordsmanship training together. Scarlet considers it as a token that proves Demia is her best training partner as well as her closest friend. Scarlet has never used it, worrying that it might get a scratch.","Pendant made by Scarlet, whose principles won't let her ignore injustice or kneel in the face of cowardice. She gifted one each to the people she relies on: Clause and Demia. The shining wings of the royal emerald, which symbolize justice, are embedded inside the pendant. One can straighten oneself out by staring at the pendant that reflects one's eyes. She looks at it each time she feels despair by looking at the people who lay blame on her father Veroglance II.","A celebratory flag that was made to praise the king when Orvelia was first founded. Whenever she sees the flag in the office, it angers her to think of the treacherous subjects who reduced her father to a scarecrow and the flatterers who ruined the country. This made Scarlet even more determined to restore Orvelia's days of glory and to establish a stronger throne.","Blacksmith Jin especially worked on this jewel for Scarlet of Orvel. It was made as a pendant at first, but later was crafted again into a charm that Scarlet could put on and take off from her armor and clothes when she joined the war as a knight. When she was in the battlefield with the Heart of Silver, soldiers would think of her as the goddess of victory."]}},"skins":[],"voice":{"actor":{"jp":"N/A","kr":"N/A","en":"N/A"},"lines":{"jp":[],"kr":[],"en":[]}}}
