In the past, she was once a warrior at the Orvel Arena, and a rival to Gladi. When Gladi began to spend more time running a shop than conquering the Arena, Nicky lost interest too and found another job. Somewhat skilled in training monsters, she applied to be the Stockade's Chief Guard, which is a dangerous yet well-paid job. While the inmates usually refrain from doing anything out of their fear for her, from time to time, they would lose all sense of reason and cause a scene. With each incident like that, her mace drew blood, leaving the inmates to cower in fear again.","itemIntroductions":{"weapon":"The mace wielded by the Chief Guard to keep the inmates under control. It is known as the Mace of Rehabilitation for the unruly monsters in captivity. Although it was passed down from one Stockade Chief Guard in Orvelia to another across generations, soon after Nicky became the new chief, she broke a part of the mace while mercilessly swinging it at the prisoners. -......... She was staring at the broken mace when she turned her eyes to the prisoners. Her eyes stopped at the Hell Beast Hartnon whose entire body was covered with horns. A cruel grin appeared on her face. - You! You've got a pretty eyeball for a piece of trash! In time, the monster's eye went through Blacksmith Jin's hands and became Nicky's new mace. The new mace was perfect for her. The horns sprouting from the mace exuded an excruciating curse, while the deep grudge ingrained in the monster's iris offering ensured a soul-crushing pain. The inmates began to call the new mace 'Hartnon' in remembrance of the beast sacrificed for the weapon. Nicky felt a surge of incomparable pleasure whenever she'd swing the new mace at the prisoners.","treasures":["A pair of boots made with the leather of monsters rampaging in the Stockade. On the first day that Nicky started working as the chief guard, she was upset to see the monsters wreaking havoc in the place. As the monsters lunged at her, she swung her mace and smashed their skulls with a cold smile on her face. Nicky then skinned the monsters and made a pair of boots out of their leather. Since then, none of the prisoners at the Stockade have ever given her any trouble.","A pendant acquired from a fight with the Gladi, Nicky's lifelong rival. It is known that in the past, the War God of Orbis Continent imbued his power into the pendant so that it could be used for possible future crisis. Inside the jewel is a flame, blazing like the soul of a fighter. When it came to the auction house, Gladi and Nicky fought days and nights for it, neither having the upper hand. Was what happened next an act of mischief by the Goddess? When the fight grew particularly fierce, the wind delivered the scent of silver vine. Gladi, lured by the sweet scent, gave up the fight and ran outside. Eventually, Nicky won the pendant.","A strange knuckle bought from Cassandra while she was visiting Orvelia. Cassandra met Nicky at the Inn, cursing and complaining about her disobedient prisoners, and sold her this item. According to Cassandra, the skulls on the knuckle are made from the bones of high wizards, and the one with red eyes has the ability to cause hallucinations and endlessly torture enemies. Nicky is using it, along with her mace, to punish felons.","A black manicure that Nicky puts on the day of waste disposal in the Stockade. Nicky always hated when her nails would be stained with blood after completing waste disposal'. Different monsters had different blood colors, and her nails would get very messy after. One day, she was letting loose a stream of abuse, infuriated by her messy nails, when she saw a lady with nails of various colors and came up with an idea. If she didn't like her nails getting stained with different colors, all she had to do was put some dark color on her nails beforehand! She picked the monsters with the darkest blood and made a bottle of special manicure. She now applies it on her nails every waste disposal day. When she comes into the Stockade with her nails in black, all the prisoners shiver in fear of death."]}},"skins":[],"voice":{"actor":{"jp":"N/A","kr":"N/A","en":"N/A"},"lines":{"jp":[],"kr":[],"en":[]}}}
