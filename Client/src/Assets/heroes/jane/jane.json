The Republic of Gray, wiped off the map by the Demon invaders during the Demon War, was the protector of countless secrets, including the ruins and technologies of an ancient civilization. Jane, too, lost her life to protect those secrets. Later, she was brought back to the world as an undead by Malduk, a high-ranking officer and a strategist of the Demon Army. She was given a new consciousness by a strange, dark magic. Now, she seeks to go on a journey to find her past self and her lost memories.","itemIntroductions":{"weapon":"When Malduk's magic resurrected Jane as an undead, she should not have felt anything. Yet, she felt warm and comfortable as mysterious energy surrounded her dead body. She should not have been able to even feel it. But when Malduk took her, she instinctively reached out to the warm presence. Later, when a mysterious magic brought her back to consciousness, the first thing she did was to inspect her coffin, which radiated with tragic yet warm love. Inside, she found the following message carefully engraved: 'My unchanging love for you.'","treasures":["A doll used in funeral ceremonies in the Republic of Gray.

Seeing Jane's eyes locked on the limited edition of Rephy Doll on the shop display, Epis decided to buy her the doll. Since the doll could only be purchased with mileage, Epis was almost crying after spending all her pocket money. However, Jane's smile after getting this doll as her first friend was probably worth it."]}},"skins":[],"voice":{"actor":{"jp":"N/A","kr":"N/A","en":"N/A"},"lines":{"jp":[],"kr":[],"en":[]}}}
