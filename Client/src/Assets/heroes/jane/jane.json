Later, when a mysterious magic brought her back to consciousness, the first thing she did was to inspect her coffin, which radiated with tragic yet warm love. Inside, she found the following message carefully engraved: 'My unchanging love for you.'",
      "soul": "The unwavering love of the one who yearns for his dearest and endearing Jane, and the ardent wish of Jane to meet that person became the very seed that was planted in Erekura. Whenever Jane recovered her lost emotion, the seed entwined deeper with Jane and took the form Of a thorny vine that protects her. The soul of Erekura which started sprouting and extending its reach bloomed every time her emotions became stronger and deeper, as if it was resonating with Jane.\nWhen Jane finally reunited with the one whom she yearned for so dearly. the slumbering flower buds resonated with her overjoyed heart and fully blossomed into flowers. Wherever the pollen from these bloomed flowers touch, the place becomes covered in flowers of the fallen republic, leaving scarlet hills behind.",

Seeing Jane's eyes locked on the limited edition of Rephy Doll on the shop display, Epis decided to buy her the doll. Since the doll could only be purchased with mileage, Epis was almost crying after spending all her pocket money. However, Jane's smile after getting this doll as her first friend was probably worth it."
