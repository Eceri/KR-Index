While investigating, Demia found a blue ore, the likes of which she had never seen before. Numerous wizards and alchemists studied this mysterious ore with the characteristics of both gem and metal, but no one could figure out its identity. Jin the blacksmith, however, had a different idea. As soon as he saw the ore, he offered Demia to craft powerful gears out of it, with a big smile on his face.
