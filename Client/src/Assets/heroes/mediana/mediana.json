    "story": "A practitioner of the medical arts developed when priests were short in supply. She inherited her natural medical talent from her father, but her thirst for knowledge crossed the line when she began researching poison. As a result, she was excommunicated from medical society, but her enthusiasm for research was seemingly unaffected. However, her basic respect for life kept her from achieving any experimental results for her poison research. When the Demons appeared, she became overjoyed at finding rare and precious test subjects.",

      "weapon": "The story goes back to when Mediana's poison experiments were still being kept secret from her peers. One day, a fellow doctor noticed the giant syringe she had made. Impressed by its sheer size, he asked her: 'Look at the size of that thing. Shouldn't you at least give it a name?' To this, Mediana replied, nonchalantly: 'Oh... Just call it... Piston.'",
      "treasures": [
        "A collection of Mediana's special healthy injections. These liquids are all made up of unknown substances and have a mystical glimmer. These were made with folk remedies that Mediana learned from every corner of the continent. Mediana insists that they provide recovery, but their abuse can lead to some extreme results.",
        "A special potion that has two type of effects. Mediana wondered if there was a way to handle attack and recovery at once. She went to the library and read a dusty book called 'Slimes Can Also Make Cannons.' Mediana was reading just for fun, but found a way to apply the principle of cannons into her piston. She was then able to invent the Special Potion of Double Reaction and maximize recovery and attack when using Special Water Cannon. Mediana is still thankful to the author of the book who gave her the inspiration.",
        "A special potion that has the teachings of a master. The genius surgeon and expert on anatomy, Doctor Aldini, is Mediana's master. Doctor Aldini recognized her talent early on, and he taught her extraordinary medical knowledge that couldn't have been imagined in the Church of Lua. The unidentifiable potion that was made with her master's special recipe increases the effect of the Strengthening Potion.",
        "A strange medical test report that Doctor Aldini gave to his student, Mediana. For a long time, he had kept notes about the autopsies he performed, and handed the records to Mediana, hoping that the traditional art of medicine would live on in her hands. Filled with joy, she has read it numerous times, and it was this report that made Mediana's Special Poison possible."
