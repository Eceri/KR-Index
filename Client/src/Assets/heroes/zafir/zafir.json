As the young leader of the Mauhata tribe of Desert Warriors, he has been trained and educated to be the worthy successor to the great king. When the Trovatia tribe, their sworn brothers, were praying at the Shrine of Flow to awake the God Dragon, he led his warriors to defeat all demons approaching the oasis. Assisted by the God Dragon and Laudia, her priestess, he is fulfilling his role as a Desert Warrior defending his home. He hopes that his efforts make the late God King proud.",

      "soul": "A descendant of the God King must bear the fate of the desert, and rise above all its people like the sun.\nTo become that sun, one does not need great strength and charisma. One needs be of the right bloodline.\nThe people of the desert will follow the one who has proved that he is the successor of the bloodline, no matter how lowly that person may appear to be.\nThe most direct, sure way of proving such is by being chosen by Zaries.\nIn the past, when Cain bound his soul to the desert, the desert gave birth to Zaries which would act as the medium, the proof of the desert's loyalty toward Cain. As Zaries always stays by Cain's side and gives blessing of the desert to the worthy, one who is chosen by Zaries is most certainly recognized as the one blessed by the God King's desert.\nZaries took a form of a bow, fell into a slumber, and waited for a descendant of the God King who would awaken its true form.\n\nAfter passing the trial of the ancient God King, Zafir gained the ability to detect the soul of Zaries. Zafir, the chosen of Zaries, and the one accepted as the true descendant of the God King, heeds to the call of the God King, and makes his enemies tremble in fear with his might desert storm.",

        "A treasure that Zafir received from the Mauhata tribe. It's an arrow made with the tail feather of an animal regarded as holy in the ancient kingdom. Its radiance is blinding, as if representing the honor and glory of the ancient kingdom. Normally, it's hung on a wall and used in ceremonies, but it's actually one of the best defense weapons used by the royal family. Enemies shot by this arrow face the Judgment of the Desert within a massive sandstorm.",
        "An hourglass that was buried underground for a long time by an enormous sandstorm that struck Aegina Desert. When the sand in the hourglass moves, it calls for the mirage of an ancient city coming back to life. The high priest of the ancient kingdom used this to show the glory of the kingdom to its people in the past. Seeing their city shining in gold, people grew proud of their kingdom.",
        "A magical sword passed down through the God King's descendants. The name 'Oasis' comes from how it was used to serve the people in dire times. After the kingdom fell, its whereabouts was unknown to the world until Zafir saw it among Kumuro's art collections and bought it at an incredibly high price. With the sword finally returning to the worthy descendant, Zafir was able to inherit his forefather's spirits, maximizing his potentials.",
        "It is known that a black cat always stayed next to the God King in the Ancient Desert Kingdom as a symbol of peace and prosperity. No one knows how the sacred black cat appears generation after generation. When the same black cat came to Zafir, he named it 'Hoabis,' and he has been taking care of it wholeheartedly."
