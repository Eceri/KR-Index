Ever since childhood, she has lived under the weight of responsibility of the throne she would eventually inherit. When she finally realized that the victory of her kingdom was only made possible by the sacrifices of her people, she swore to never hide from her duties. She would face the pressure of royal responsibility with courage. Penteonia has historically been a selfish kingdom, only interested in its own safety. Now, with Artemia as its ruler, everything is about to change.",

This Light Staff, known to respond only to those worthy of sainthood, radiated with splendid light in the hands of the young Artemia, as if to honor the future empress. It calls upon the power of absolute light, unleashing heaven's vengeance upon its enemies while protecting its wielder with divine light.",
      "soul": "Whenever Artemia used her magic, she felt that she is indeed, the chosen.\n\nDuring her yound days, Artemia did not consider her staff special. However, as she witnessed how her staff drew the magic of light as if it was guiding the light, and how the power from the staff embraced her warmly, she started to accept the staff as not just a simple weapon, but as her most reliable compannion.\n'As long as i have you in my hands, I am the most incandescent light that brilliantly lights the world.'\nJust as she promised, Artemia felt the most reliable light from behind her.\n\nAnd just like her, Brauxio think of Artemia earnestly.",

Made with smithing skills that the blacksmith learned from dwarves, the jewel on it has a mystical power. It can concentrate Artemia's energy of light and release it all at once.",
        "Earrings made from light kveril, a rare mineral that is said to only come out in Penteonia. When Artemia was crowned Empress, she received it along with the crown. It doesn't lose its light even at night, and it actually shines even more brightly in the dark. It's known as the jewel of principles and brilliance amongst the people. An item that raises the dignity of the queen as they shine from her ears.",
        "A crown that is passed down to the king of Penteonia. A part of it had been broken by a previous tyrant, but it's been repaired. A new red gem called the Soul of the Sun has been embedded at the center of the crown. Its dignified form compels one to kneel before it in a show of respect.",
        "A mystical mirror that contains the spells of royal elder wizards, passed down to generations in the royal family of Penteonia. It is known that the first king made it himself for the eternal prosperity of Penteonia. Only the leader of the country could look into it, and the one standing in front of the mirror receives the blessing of light. This would then lead the kings to be the light themselves to all his people in the country."
