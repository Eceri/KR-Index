This time however, the user was not like any other Baroro came across.\nAlthough merely a harpy, she not only withstood Baroro's mental attack, but also freely wielded the evil gauntlet.\nFurthermore, her noble resolve and her brilliant will eventually overwhelm the Evil Demon. After succumbing to its master's strong mind, Baroro as an evil that devours other evil fervently vanquishes its master's enemies.",
