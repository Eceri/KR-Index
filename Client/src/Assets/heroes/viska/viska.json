It constantly injects fear into its victim's soul, reducing even the most formidable enemy to mere prey.",

Viska however, was different. To her, fear was something to conquer, not to be afraid of.\nThat is why Viska challenged Kitrax face to face, crushed her fear, and annexed her strength.\n\nAfter this day, Viska became a subject of fear among the Demons.\nShe abused her newly-acquired power and became someone even more vicious than Kitrax. Over time, the number of Demons who would face Viska in the Pandemonium surely diminished.\n\nBut Viska did not care.\nTo her, it was one of the means to find those strong enough to confront her.\nViska wished to fight an opponent who can overcome even the fear of Kitrax, not the worthless ones who cannot even overcome that nightmare.\n\nViska continued to feast the Demons who challenged her, and it is told that she surpassed the limit after accumulating enough strength, and gradually turned into a great demon deserving of a title: Dark Lord.",

When she couldn't find anything nice to eat around her, she came up with a brilliant idea. She thought that taking the dreams out of the Nightmare Jewels that Nightmare Kitrax had and storing her memory of eating delicious prey would allow her to relive those past pleasures. Excited, she imbued the jewel with the memory of eating a delicious demon, and ever since, Viska has been seeking for better-tasting things to put in the jewels.",
        "Claw of the violent magic beast Urgol, who is said to bite off souls. The day Viska decided to hunt in the Material World, she devoured Urgol from the Demon World. Combined with the ability that Viska has to absorb the power of others, it displayed great power, and it is essential to eat Demons who trespassed to the Material World.",

But battle isn't all about strength, but using one's brain as well. The giant demon was defeated and eaten by a predator who used her brain. The power to get big became Viska's, and she can use it freely now.",
        "Crystallized Mana energy of 'Araneck,' a beast that swallowed 'Gluttony' and one of the beasts of 7 sins killed by Viska after she came over to the material world. The crystal has the ability to visualize the force of its owner with a color through the jewel in the center. It was transparent at first, but when Viska touched it, it let out a radiant red light, with a small pattern appearing on the surface. The pattern has grown bigger as Viska's powers grew, and she would sometimes think of what the pattern would look like when she becomes the Dark Lord."
