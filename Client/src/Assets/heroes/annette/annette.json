She only wished to invent items that would help, protect, and make humans happy.\nShe had zero intention of unmaking Rascal. Rascal was her friend, her inventor partner, and a great assistant.\nThe source of Annette's happiness was watching Rascal improve.\nThere was no way Annette would think about being separated from it.\nMeanwhile, Rascal strives to upgrade itself more and more to please Annette who always watched it with a grand expectation...",
