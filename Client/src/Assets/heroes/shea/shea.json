All the other soldiers present also dropped their swords.' 'It felt as though the girl was in an entirely different plane of existence, removed from the rest of us.' The sensational tale of the pink-haired girl, whose sudden appearance and performance stopped the battle, quickly spread. Her beautiful, captivating melody and her demure, lovely presence has captured everyone's imagination. However, no one really knew where she came from or where she was headed. 'She seemed kind of strange to me, the way she was talking to thin air, as if there was somebody there...' Of course, some have suggested more convincing theories on the girl’s whereabouts, but her mysterious beauty has drowned out all speculation.",

This harp, which insists that it be called 'Mr. Schute,' can significantly amplify the wielder’s mana and spray it all around the wielder. Since the amplified mana is scattered about, it cannot be effectively used as offensive magic. However, depending on how it's used it can prove to be extremely effective in other ways. Mr. Schute is quite a chatterbox, but only to those he considers as his friends. These days he only talks to Shea.",
      "soul": "Schwanheite, or Mr. Schube, is a talkative harp that occasionally tells the tale of the time when he was a human, The bard of free spirit would talk about the time when he sang the songs of love and whispered love to beautiful fiancés who were often the source of inspiration. He would often end up swimming in the sea of nostalgia.\n'Oh, good times they were. That witch caused a worldly loss by cursing me. Oh, my lovely fiancées, how I miss thee.' Staring with the lamentation. Mr, Schube would go on day and night to tell Shea his past stories, and this lead to Shea fantasizing about forms or love.\nBoth Shea and Mr. Schube were full of love, but their definitions of love were slightly different.\nBut what would it feel like to love something or someone with an endlessly burning passion? What would a burning passion, burning love feel like? A simple curiosity of a girl breathed in a new wind to the soul of the talkative harp.\n'Want me to tell you about it?'\nMr. Schube took the form of a human and appeared with a sudden flash of light, flashing a grin. Shea responded:\n\n'Yes! Eh, but before that, how should I play you now that you are a human?'",

        "A mystical flower that contains the energy of life. Unlike the flora of pandemonium that grows from evil residue, the flower of life gets nutrients from clean, pure substances such as dewdrops of dawn and the energy of the star-filled Milky Way. The pure energy that the flower stored during its growth becomes a great support to Shea when she plays Green Nature's Melody.",
        "A flower that was by Shea's head the day after she performed Happiness from the Wind. According to Schwanheite, it was also a gift from the fairies of the forest for her beautiful music. It contains Shea's wish that the wind will carry happiness all over the world.",
        "A chaplet that was by Shea's head the day after she performed Lullaby to the Dreams in the forest. According to Schwanheite, it was a gift from the fairies of the forest for her beautiful music. It is said that items that went through the hands of fairies have the power to return a soul back to its purest form.",
        "When Shea sang the song of life with the spirits for the creatures on earth, Mira, the goddess of love, gave her this jewel in return in her dream. When Shea woke up, she found it in her hand. The jewel shines like the goddess of love herself, and people would feel amazed by just looking at it. Shea decided to call it the Dream of Mira."
