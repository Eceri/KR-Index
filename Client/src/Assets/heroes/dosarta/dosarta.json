According to the rules, those from a royal family in the position of guardian almost never get released from their duty before their service ends, but desperate times call for all sorts of exceptions. Dosarta was allowed to leave the Tower of Challenge to carry out missions if need be, and now she's determined to use the opportunity to make a lot of friends. How many friends could this Elven guardian make?","itemIntroductions":{"weapon":"An ancient shield made with a drawing found in the Tower of Challenge and Artifact Pieces that were left over after restoration. The shield holds ancient protective spells, whose limits remain unknown to the world. Even Dosarta herself is not fully acquainted with its powers, but she doesn't really care either. 'I have plenty of time to play around with it and figure out what it does,' was what she said. Guarding the Tower of Challenge was so boring that even training her skills became a pastime for her.","treasures":["A pair of blue bracelets that resembles the thick and lively forest of Elidora. One of the hobbies that Dosarta took up in her lonely hours in the Tower of Challenge was handicraft, and this powerful magical tool is filled with the vitality of Elidora. Dosarta thinks that they're merely a pair of pretty-looking accessories though...","An ancient crystal orb passed down in the royal family of Elidora. It's a magical tool made with Artifact Pieces by the royal Elves running the Tower of Challenge. It is said that the owner of this crystal orb can talk to anyone in the world remotely, wherever they are. To respond to any contingencies in the Tower of Challenge, the royal family made it a rule that only the manager of the Tower of Challenge can keep it in possession. Despite its strategic and historical importance, the crystal is nothing but a means of communication to Dosarta that she uses to have casual conversations with her big sister, Selene.","An ornament that Dosarta made to play with Wind Elementals while guarding the Tower of Challenge all alone. She ground the Mana stones that the elementals like, added the powder into the metal treated with Elven magic, and infused it with Rune Magic. Maybe the effort put into this plaything was a little bit too much. It restores the natural powers of elementals. However, rumor has it that Dosarta was downhearted when the Elementals came and did nothing but sit around near it without doing anything fun with its maker.","Aulen, the Bird of Wind, is a symbol of the royal family of Elidora. Its blue feathers are known to raise a soft, refreshing wind. Selene used to have a pet Aulen that Dosarta took great care of. When Dosarta left her home to the Tower of Challenge, Selene made this quill with a feather from her beloved Aulen to make her feel close to it all the time. Dosarta has never used it since she got it, and she just keeps it in a safe place."]}},"skins":[],"voice":{"actor":{"jp":"N/A","kr":"N/A","en":"N/A"},"lines":{"jp":[],"kr":[],"en":[]}}}
