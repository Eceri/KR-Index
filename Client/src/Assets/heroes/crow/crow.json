Crow was walking on the street of Orvelia and saw this old music box in the shop display. He stood still on the road, looking at it for a long time, and went inside the shop. He wound the music box and stood there, listening to the melody silently. - It's the same one. - I said I would buy her a new one, but she just liked this old, worn music box.
