It has been crafted from enchanted ice that never melts. Considered a holy relic among Barbarians, this weapon is bestowed to their mightiest warrior. The wielder of this weapon is the most powerful warrior among Barbarians, and may be considered their king.",

The Barbarians started praising Gau's display of diligence and truthfulness, and one by one, the Barbarians recognized him as their leader.\nNuminu, who was watching over Gau ever since the beginning, launched itself far upwards the sky and incarnated before Gau.\nIt was the day Gau became the true king of the Barbarians.",
