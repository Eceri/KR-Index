As a combat homunculus, she boasts excellent physical abilities as well. Beneath her appearance as a young girl, she is a confused war machine searching for the meaning of her existence. The wizards of the Tower of Sage bestowed her the title of 'Blue' to indicate her mastery over chant-less spell casting. However, she distrusts wizards and has no desire to associate herself with the Tower.",

She has shown great talent in making magic gear, and this is the first weapon she ever created. It's a bit lacking in stability, mostly due to the overwhelming electricity it contains. The powerful electrical storm created by this weapon is truly dangerous for any enemy. In fact, anyone besides Sonia who touches it would be instantly fried by the immense current that flows through it.",
      "soul": "As her power grew, Sonia felt Baikal's presence growing stronger within her, to the point where she occasionally felt as if she was acting at Baikal's will, not at her own will.\nWhen she had a thought that she may completely be consumed by Baikal's will, Sonia took a special measure\n\nShe had a thought of her own existence.\nSonia, a homunculus built upon the core, Baikal's heart.\nHer weapon is a magic gear with a design inspired by Baikal's heart, her core.\nIt is a powerful weapon capable of releasing a strong lightning by drawing maximum power from Sonia's heart - a great item worthy to be called Baikal's second heart.\n\nSonia, after creating a direct mana pathway that connects Baikal's heart and Yandis, closed her eyes and focused on her power.\nIt is a Divine Beast composed of breathtakingly elegant blue lightning, a being so unique that no creatures share its similarity, one named Baikal.\nTo Sonia, Baikal is like a guardian, and a parent who is the very reason Sonia could come to exist...\n\nSonia opened her eyes again after mentally visualizing her power, and saw Baikal who was gently watching over Sonia.",

The sages in the tower gave her the jewel, hoping that she would stay. However, she left the tower anyway, repulsed by the existence of wizards. She left the jewel in the tower, but at some point during her journey, she realized that it somehow ended up in her pocket.",
        "A cloak that Mirianne made for Sonia by braving a danger. There was a time when Sonia's clothes would burn from the explosion of the electricity that ran through her body. Mirianne saw that and plucked out the ereth plant that is said to grow by being struck by lightning. She pulled out its thread and completed a cloak with it. Sonia saw Mirianne's blistered hands from the electricity, and she cried in silence for a long time. A piece of clothing just for Sonia that can't be found anywhere else.",
        "Heart of Vikal, who is called a holy beast. He eats the elements of light and dark from the world, so his heart is full of thunder from the collision between the two elements. If someone unskilled were to touch it, he would be absorbed by its power. But Sonia, who is made up of the core of lightning, absorbed that power and obtained mana that is beyond imaginable.",
        "An artifact crafted by Sonia herself that contains the enormous lightning energy generated from her heart. When the core of Vikal within her broke loose, Sonia's lightning energy would overflow and cause an inner explosion. She could not release the power as it could hurt Mirianne. Out of concern, Mirianne suggested that she make an artifact that could control it. It took Sonia a long time to make this pair of gloves durable enough to withstand her lightning energy. The result exceeded her wildest expectations. What she made was an enormous reserve of energy, which enabled her to use and control the energy without having to worry about exhaustion. Moreover, the gloves would protect Mirianne from possible explosions, which made Sonia proud."
