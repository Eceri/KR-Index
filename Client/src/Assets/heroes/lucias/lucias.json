Under the command of the Living Legend, Ricardo, he protected Orvel and neighboring towns from Demons. However, stigmata started to appear on his body when he was 19, and by the call of Lua, the holy knight became the Saint of Blessings. His mission is to travel around the world and bring the light of Lua to those in need. He stayed true to his duties, wandering the world to share blessings. Now, he holds a weapon in his hand again to defeat the power of darkness that has been growing in strength over the past 100 years.","itemIntroductions":{"weapon":"A blessed flag representing the Sun, Moon, and the entire sky. It contains the power and teachings of the Creator, Lua. The power of light spreads when he waves the flag, bringing peace to his allies' minds, defeating the powers of darkness. A halidom bestowed upon Lucias, who used to be a flag bearer in Lua's Holy Knights.","treasures":["The bible of infinity that a line of Sages of Blessings used to record their works. The title of a sage is passed down with the memories of its predecessor, so it would seem that there is no reason for them to write anything down. However, the danger of the accumulated memories erasing the identity of the present sage made writing this bible necessary.","Lucias had a cherished friend back when he was young. This friend was a member of a troupe named Stardust. He had very nimble hands despite his young age and used to pickpocket countless wallets from gamblers. However, Stardust would only visit Lucias's town once a year, and so the two friends gave each other something they treasured to remember their friendship. This dice is the special trick dice made by Lucias's friend, Esker.","Research materials about the stigmata of the Saint of Blessings. Although Lucias has the memories of the saints, they did not know everything. Lua's priests left this document after researching the secret behind the stigmata, but it was impossible for them to bring everything to light.","The holy sword that Lucias used when he was under Ricardo's command as a Holy Knight. High priests of Lua blessed it directly, imbuing it with strong holy energy. Lucia was later chosen as the Saint of Blessings, and his blessings are actually much more powerful than the blessing invested in the sword. He always carries the sword to remember his days as the Holy Knight, but he never draws it. Gossipers say that it is because he fears he would not look like a saint if he is to be seen wielding a sword..."]}},"skins":[],"voice":{"actor":{"jp":"N/A","kr":"N/A","en":"N/A"},"lines":{"jp":[],"kr":[],"en":[]}}}
