Since childhood, he has always been a black sheep in the Church of Lua that emphasizes piety. He entered the church with the help of the High Priest Berman, but the religious life was painfully ill-suited for him. One day, however, he suddenly decided to quit his deviant ways, and started following the path of the high priesthood.","itemIntroductions":{"weapon":"Even among the holy relics bestowed to the high priests of the Church of Lua, the God's Book Genesis is special. According to the legend, this book, guarded throughout the ages by the Grand Priests of the church, was written by Lua herself. Iris, the current Grand Priest, upon receiving a revelation regarding Baudouin, entrusted this book to his step father, Berman. Later, the book was given to Baudouin when he became a high priest. It is said that this divine relic provides infinite holy energy to its owner, along with the power to unlock the true potential of those who have faith.","treasures":["A wooden grail that has Goddess Lua's face engraved on it. When the people first learned of Lua's existence, they made a grail for her in praise of her divinity. As the civilization in Orbis Continent fell, the grail was also buried underground, and it's only been mentioned in records. However, on the day that Baudouin repented his sins and realized the truth of the holy book, this old grail appeared in front of him, shining like the sun.","The last chapter of the legend that was too horrifying and terrifying to put in the Bible. It talks about the holy light that kills the darkest enemy in the world.","The rosary that holy priest Evelyn of the Church of Lua carried until her death. It's as if Lua's holy voice can be heard from the rosary, praying that the world won't collapse. The undeniable holy energy engulfs the body, and it maximizes Baudouin's power.","The last journal of a great teacher. It contains the treatment that Priest Berman carried out for Dark Plague patients, and his own battle with his illness. Baudouin managed to save this from the flames when they were burning the teacher's belongings after he died. Then, he transcribed it with Leo and named it Berman's Journal, which made a great contribution to Dark Plague treatment. The original journal is kept by Baudouin in safekeeping, reminding him of his teacher's will."]}},"skins":[],"voice":{"actor":{"jp":"N/A","kr":"N/A","en":"N/A"},"lines":{"jp":[],"kr":[],"en":[]}}}
