The true companion of the girl destined to chase the fate of the world was born.\n\nAs the constellation of insight itself, Ophelia's two eyes will witness and carry the fate of the world.\nFor she is the Pathfinder of Fate who will carry out her painful but grand destiny...",

Then, a wizard started searching for it to prevent any more meaningless killing, found it, and sealed it away. No one has seen the card for centuries until Ophelia found it in an old storeroom.",

There is usually a thread piece or two left behind whenever a fate is manipulated, and Ophelia would tie the ends of the pieces and watch them magically fuse and form a string as if they were never apart. This spool of thread is the result of her habit."
