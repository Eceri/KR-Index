After developing her own theories and systems of Rune Magic, she quickly grew bored and moved onto a different subject. Soon, she was appointed as the highest ranking royal secretary of finance. Unfortunately, many politicians refused to accept a commoner as their superior. After many lies and ill rumors, Veronica eventually decided to leave the palace on her own. But this was hardly a defeat for her, and she soon set out to conquer a new path. She headed to the Orvel Guild Alliance, where she would be measured only by her abilities and nothing else. As expected, her incredible perception and analytical skills made her an indispensable asset to numerous guilds.",

The letters that are written by the writer cannot be erased without the writer's mana. Also, text can be written on the magic parchment without any limit, and it has a function to search for stuff one has written before. It makes Veronica's work that much more effective. Of course, it's useful when it's used for work, but outside of work...",

Thus, Veronica started the experiment on Accordio to enhance its capabilities, so that it can have stronger abilities. Although she had strayed away from magic and academia since leaving the Tower of Sage, her innate ingenuity allowed Veronica to smoothly proceed with the research.\nAt last, when Veronica's research reached its climax, Accordio finally awakened as a being with its own shape and ego, as if it was impressed by Veronica's persistence and her challenging spirit.",

With the power of magic, the letters written by this pen turn red when the actions are not carried out accordingly. Veronica says it's very helpful when managing supplies.",
