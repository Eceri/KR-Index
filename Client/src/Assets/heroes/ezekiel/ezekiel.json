    "story": "The son of Lucikiel is a powerful Demon officer who brought down the Republic of Gray. Usually considerate and careful, he is actually half Human. In battle, his Demon blood takes over, turning him arrogant and violent. He inherited this power from his father, whom he never even knew. However, he takes pride in his power and does not try to hide it. Since he is only partly Demon, only a single arm undergoes the transformation. However, even just this single arm contains immense power, and it's certainly not easy for him to fully control it yet. If he loses the control of the arm, the only wise decision is to immediately get as far away from him as possible.",
    "itemIntroductions": {
      "weapon": "Ezekiel's father was one of the highest-ranking Demons. Although he does not know his father's name or face, he is aware of the tremendous power of the Demon blood he inherited. The Demon blood flowing within his veins also gave him a second personality. When his human blood prevails, Ezekiel is a young man of excellent character. At other times, he is an immensely powerful and arrogant Demon, just like his father. Barbatos, Jailer of Despair, manifests itself when Ezekiel's Demon blood is in full power. Taking the form of one of his arms, this weapon is powerful enough to slash through dimensions and sever the space itself. It is the physical representation of his father's power.",
      "soul": "Ever since birth, Ezekiel has never used the power of his arm to the fullest.\nHis human side could not control the power perfectly, and his Demon side has never felt the need to use the power beyond what was already being used, However, through the long journey which Ezekiel started following a coincidental encounter, Ezekiel found those who he wished to protect.\nThe problem, however, was that 'protecting someone' required much more strength and effort than 'killing someone'. To become stronger than what he was, Ezekiel had to find his own way of using power. Since he was not a pure human, its ways had limits.\nHowever, since Ezekiel was also not a pure Demon, its way was not an option to him either. Ezekiels, wrought in agony over their power, had a discussion on one possible option: Fully unleashing the power acquired from father. No power can be properly wielded without understanding it, It was the one thing Ezekiels heard from a credible person. To Ezekieľ's surprise, the power of Demon, unleashed with a strong intent, was devastating. His claws left a long cut on a dimension. Ezekiel had witnessed such, and when he approached the dimension's scar with a surprised look, a dense demonic energy leaked out from the scar, Although he had never come into contact with one, the energy felt familiar to him.\nThat moment, Ezekiel realized what he had done. He understood the nature of the demonic energy. From then and onwards, Ezekiel could see the power of Barbatos directly.",
      "treasures": [
        "When Ezekiel made a choker with Manticore's leather, he made a double-layered leather belt along with it. The leather has the unique quality of holding demonic energy and causing insanity, so this belt casts fear on the surrounding area when Ezekiel explodes his demonic power. This binds and immobilizes those with weak minds.",
        "Choker made with the skin of a powerful beast. Loot that celebrates the manticore that Ezekiel hunted after a hard battle against the Demons when he was young. Ezekiel remembers the joy of killing the manticore every time he touches the violent beast's choker, just before he charges at the formidable enemy in front of him.",
        "A bond containing the mana of an unknown priest. Young Ezekiel used to go berserk frequently. If anyone insulted his mom, he would allow his boiling demon blood to take over. Once he return to his senses, he would stare at his wounded arm and his terrified mom. When he was older, Ezekiel was getting rid of demons when he got into an argument with a bigger priest of Lua. He went berserk, just like any other day. Ezekiel was alone when he came to, and he was taken aback by the bond on his cursed arm. When he tried to take it off, he found that the priest's magic couldn't be shaken off so easily. However, he stopped going berserk and losing his consciousness after that. He's gained greater control over his mana, so it's now one of his most treasured items.",
        "Sudden surges of energy on young Ezekiel's right arm left countless wounds and scars on his arms and hands. When the arm is calm and the blood drips on the floor, his mind would settle with his eyes fixated on the blood. Ezekiel would wait until the blood stops, pick up a stone soaked in his blue blood, and start carving a small sculpture that looks like his own right hand."
