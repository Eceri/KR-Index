He quickly rose to the rank as the vice-captain of the Imperial Guard and is the subject of everyone's admiration.

Because the effect is gradual, there is no sudden stress to the wielder's body. Each piece is called Blood and Rose, respectively. The names originated from the swirl of blood splatter and flower petals that follow whenever Fluss swings these twin swords. No other warrior has been able to utilize their potential as Fluss does.","treasures":["A belt that Fluss's father gave him when he was appointed Vice Grand Master of the knights.
