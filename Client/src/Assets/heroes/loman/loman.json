The royal family trusts him so much that they appointed Loman as the Gatekeeper of the Orvel Monarchy. He is usually a gentle and friendly man, but becomes uncompromising when anyone tries to approach his king without royal permission. No one who has seen his halberd, the one bestowed by Scarlet, split the air has ever returned alive. While off duty, however, he is a sensitive man who enjoys wood carving as a hobby.",

      "weapon": "The halberd held by an ancient guardian statue defending the gate of the labyrinth that was recently discovered at the Royal Underground. The old, eroded statue was holding the halberd firmly in its hands, as if showing its determination to protect the labyrinth against intruders. Loman, who was in charge of the labyrinth excavation, felt something indescribably sublime from the statue and showed due courtesy in front of it. At that moment, the statue dropped its halberd to the ground and began to crumble away. The halberd itself seemed unaffected by time and was imbued with a mysterious energy. 'That statue suddenly crumbled and dropped the halberd...' Scarlet said, glancing over the report. 'Yes, ma'am.' Scarlet then gazed at Loman. 'The unyielding sincerity of protecting a place until his very body collapses... I know a man like that.' 'Pardon, ma'am?' He looked at Scarlet with a puzzled face as she handed over the halberd, smiling.",
      "soul": "One day, when Loman was guarding the Ancient Royal Vault, a gigantic and ruthless monster attempted to break out. Loman faced the creature alone, and upon hearing the outbreak, the royal palace immediately sent soldiers to the vault. When the soldiers arrived, they saw Loman who was struggling alone to repel the monster. The soldiers charged toward the monster to aid Loman, but when the soldiers surrounded the monster, it went on a full rampage and lashed out brutal attacks against the soldiers. Seeing his colleagues getting hurt, Loman blamed himself for his incompetence to stop the monster. He felt a strong urge to save them. That moment, his honest and sincere nature pure as water combined with the great trust of his colleagues toward Loman, Gaiamenes released its true power to help Loman fulfill his will.",
      "treasures": [
        "A basic martial arts that covers the basics that all Orvel knights learn. Among their many skills, Cut Ground provides a solid foundation for a knight's fighting style. It is one of the first skills knights learn, but its complicated mechanism creates a big difference in power between the novice and the proficient. Loman has read it more than a thousand times since he became a knight, and he always goes back to it whenever he feels the need for further improvement.",
        "Loman used to carve small sculptures as big as his hand while sorting out his thoughts when things went wrong. As he smoothed out their edges, he'd feel at peace, recalling how he was when he was just learning the basics. It was just a pastime at first, but soon it became his hobby, a passion that filled his room with hundreds of sculptures. And one day, Loman started to make wooden dolls to give to his friends and his men. Back then, sorcerous dolls known to protect hearts from evil were popular in Orvelia. Loman asked an old shaman who practiced ancient folk remedies to enchant his wooden dolls with a spell of protection, and he gave them to his colleagues.",
        "An heirloom of Loman's family, this special pendant is bestowed by the first King of Orvelia to Loman's family in honor of their service and loyalty to protect the Orvel Monarchy. Its true origin is unknown, but it is believed to be an accessory that has the spirit of the Guardian of Orbis Continent from an ancient civilization. The owners of this item have said the same thing. When they resolve to stake their lives to defend what is important to them, they invoke a mighty power like the waves of the sea. People now believe this blue gem invokes spirits, and it started to be called the Sea of Invocation. Loman received it as an heirloom from his father when he entered the castle, and he always keeps it with him.",
        "A shield that Loman used in the past. It is his treasure that his father, who was a gatekeeper of the royal family, gave him. Although he has not used it since he started using his halberd, he has kept the words of his father in his heart: be the gate that protects Orvelia. Whatever may come, Loman will never allow the edge of an enemy sword to cross the gate of Orvelia while he breathes."
