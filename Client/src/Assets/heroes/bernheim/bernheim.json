He had the strength of a giant and excellent judgment, so it was undeniable that he would make a great knight. However, he had a fatal flaw that kept him from being successful in Penteonia: He could not use the power of light at all. No matter how hard he tried, how strong his faith and will were, the power of light did not answer to his calling. Although all he ever wanted was to serve his nation and the Queen, the fact that his incapability was keeping him from being more than a low-level knight frustrated him. Bernheim did not give up and trained hard to handle the power of light, but his constant lack of progress slowly started to weaken his mind. One day, he visited the Central Church to study the power of light and its mechanism. It was when he was quietly reading a book that he heard a sound. It was an angelic voice calling for him. The long-accumulated frustration of Bernheim led him to where the voice was coming from, a room sealed with multiple magic barriers in the basement of the church. As he moved closer to it, the barriers vanished as if they were never there. What he saw inside the room was a sword in the shape of an angel, exuding blinding light. 'You are the chosen one', said the sword, drawing him near with holy light. Thinking that his relentless effort had finally paid off, he slowly grasped the sword. Then, his mind was drawn into the deepest darkness. The darkness that captured himâ€”it was the endless shadowy void of futility. A vessel that could never be filled; a whole other universe. In the vast darkness, Bernheim felt his mind deteriorating and his existence fading away. His mind and body was slowly being encroached by a dark, ominous power. However, Bernheim was also one of the Penteonian Knights, a Knight of Light who swore not to be defeated by darkness. He rose from the shrouding darkness, regaining consciousness with his indomitable spirit. When he came to his senses, lying on the floor, there was a giant black sword in his hand. The demonic sword with the appearance of a demon was laughing and mocking the knight who broke away from the path of light. Eventually, Bernheim was banished from Penteonia, and he started to live a new life as a mercenary in Vespia Empire with that malicious, foul-mouthed demonic sword in his hand...","itemIntroductions":{"weapon":"The name of this demonic sword means 'the one who cannot be satiated' and 'the one with ceaseless craving.' It has the power to absorb all forms of energy, evil or holy, to use them as its own. It has its own will, and a character that is very temperamental, scatterbrained, and cruel. Even Queen Artemia does not know the exact reason why this demonic sword was sealed under the Central Church in Penteonia, but rumor says that Targarios was a Dark Lord in the distant past. Considering its frivolous character, that might seem unlikely. However, there is no doubt that it has devastating powers.","treasures":["A standard issue sword of Penteonian Knights that Bernheim used before he fell for Targarios's trap. It is designed to draw out great power when imbued with the power of light. However, one day, Targarios noticed that Bernheim was trying to use other weapons instead of it. Targarios went mad and broke all the other weapons after absorbing all the powers, protections, and blessings they bore. Bernheim saw it, let out a big sigh, and threw broken metal pieces away, but he decided to carry this sword with him.","A medal of light bestowed upon him when he was conferred knighthood in Penteonia. Having the sun engraved on it, this gold medal assures the bearer that the light is always with him. Although Bernheim was deprived of his knighthood and was banished from the country, his loyalty always lies with the proud Penteonian Knights.","A commemorative goblet only given to mighty and brave mercenaries in the Empire. The wolf, the symbol of Empire, is engraved on it. In recognition of the countless victories Bernheim earned for the Empire, the royal family gave him this exquisite goblet, one of only 5 in the world. Rumor has it that the goblet has a spell that makes any drink poured into it restore stamina.","Letters that Bernheim wrote to his family after his banishment. He still has not decided whether or not to send them until now, after 7 years have passed from his banishment. The letters are mainly addressed to his brother and sister who were 5 and 10 years younger than him when he was banished."]}},"skins":[],"voice":{"actor":{"jp":"N/A","kr":"N/A","en":"N/A"},"lines":{"jp":[],"kr":[],"en":[]}}}
