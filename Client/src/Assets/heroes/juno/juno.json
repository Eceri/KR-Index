She once received an offer to work as the Royal Chef, but she refused it and opened an inn to let everyone enjoy her dishes.

As she has great pride in her culinary skills, people assume that she does not like to reply upon such magical artifacts. As a result, the most precious treasure in the culinary world is now merely a decoration in Juno's inn. When the day comes that she decides to use it, however, the world will witness a whole new level of cooking.",

One thing Juno did not notice, is that this pot had an ego.\nAll those who had possessed Tempora Fyrr became top chefs who brought joy and happiness to their customers, but those who were over-reliant on this legendary utensil met an undesirable end.\nHence, Tempora Fyrr wished to become a master of a true chef who does not rely on tools. Tempora Fyrr was deeply moved by Juno who was always honing her skills diligently. and finally appeared in front of her eyes.\nAlthough Juno still has no intention of 'relying on tools' to accomplish her goals, Tempora Fyrr will pass its past cooking knowledge to Juno to help her become the top chef.",

She tried to return it, but Kumuro smiled and disappeared after saying that the ladle was in the hands of its rightful owner. As an avid cooking tool collector, it was a great gift for Juno. Its colors are not the only thing that sets the ladle apart from ordinary ladles, but it's actually one of the legacies of the ancient civilization. Unfortunately, Juno has yet to find out that this ladle can double the pleasure of eating any food if it's used for cooking it.",

What he didn't know, however, was that the Jar would actually become a true Jar of Happiness through Juno's amazing culinary skills. With greatly improved Juno's culinary skills and the addition of Juno's Special Seasoning, an improved version of the magical broth powder that the merchant used, the jar is now one of the most important kitchen tools in Juno's inn, producing top-notch dishes.",
