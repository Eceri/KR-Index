It seems like it was part of a plan to become the greatest shaman at the time. But there are no historic records of this crystal ball, and it was found far away from the village, near Eden River. Different elemental spells are mixed up in one place, making it dangerous, so it's unknown how its powers will be released.",

Unlike the phrase [Warning! Do not eat, ever! Ever!] written on the box, the snacks inside look incredibly yummy. However, it was actually made to be used for 'very nasty pranks,' and it explodes when thrown, and its destructive power is proportional to the amount of Mana that the thrower has. After the explosion, the snack powder gathers on its own, becomes snacks again, and returns back to the box. May, with her heart throbbing, put the cute, dangerous, and strange snack box into her cart."
