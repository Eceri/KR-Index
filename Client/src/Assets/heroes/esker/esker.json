Just when everyone started forgetting about him, he came out to the world as one of the most dangerous gamblers in the secret gambling world. 'The Illusion Gambler.' That was what his challengers called him, trembling in fear. The gamblers that played with him all described him in a similar manner. As soon as they faced Esker's unique laughter, his soft voice, and his empty eyes, they all felt nauseated by the suspicion that the man in the front was reading their every move.","itemIntroductions":{"weapon":"A pair dice once used by Hexipolia, the Wandering Illusion Clown. He was a renowned mage and artist in ancient times who traveled all across the continent to give joy to people and help them forget their troubles. His performance was a solace and hope to people living in confusing times, and they loved him to the extent that they made the Moon of Hexipolia after he passed away in honor of his noble spirit. However, the mentally demanding nature of Hexipolia's craft slowly gnawed into his soul, making him suffer from loneliness and depression. He wanted to give up on his natural gift, but the shadow cast upon people was just too deep; he knew too well what his performances meant to his audience. It was his destiny to amuse people. Lu Etrona Dice is what he made to amuse himself during his painful journey of entertainment. He condensed his Mana into the dice and gave it the power to form a dimensional illusion. When rolled, the dice opened up an imaginary world where Hexipolia could find some peace. The dice was passed down to the descendants of his life-long pursuit for clowning, but it disappeared when the ancient civilization collapsed. And now, the dice is in the hands of a man called the Illusion Gambler. Being used in a completely different way, against its maker's intentions... It is said that the dice appeared in Esker's hands with blinding lights when he desperately wanted to escape this world.","treasures":["A toy cube that Esker used to play with Ophelia when she was feeling down. The Cube lets out a gleaming light when the Runic letters are put together, and starts playing a beautiful melody when completely solved. Ophelia would often feel depressed that she didn't know what the man of her destiny she met in her dreams looked like. In such cases, Esker would, just as he did to calm his sister down, take this cube out and let her watch him solve the cube.","A chess piece that belonged to Esker's performance partner in Stardust. When the magic show was over, the duo would play chess and talk about their performance earlier. The day that the 'incident' happened and Esker decided to leave the troupe, no one but his partner knew what he had in mind. Handing this chess piece in Esker's hands, he told Esker not to forget Stardust and to come back when he could.","A fishing rod for kids that Esker's childhood friend gave him as a present. There was an annoying boy living in a town that Stardust would visit during annual tours. The boy, Lucias, would read the boring bible to Esker and frighten him with stag beetles. Esker hated him for always smiling like an idiot at first, but they soon became close friends. When Stardust came to visit Lucias's town on another tour, the two exchanged a token of friendship, and this fishing rod was what Lucias gave Esker. Since then, Esker had to go fishing with Lucias every time he would come to the town.","A strange gambling chip used in black market gambling houses. This is the most valuable chip of them all, and only the best adventurer in the secret gambling house could own it. It looks like a regular golden gambling chip, but it holds life forces of countless souls due to the spell of Dark Wizards cast on it."]}},"skins":[],"voice":{"actor":{"jp":"N/A","kr":"N/A","en":"N/A"},"lines":{"jp":[],"kr":[],"en":[]}}}
