Other merchants call her 'the Merchant of Death,' but she has a different opinion. She claims that no poison is inherently evil, and that how one is used determines its nature. Like a true merchant, she believes that any tool is as good or evil as the one who uses it. Since the reappearance of the Demons, she has been traveling around, searching for the right poison to battle against the invaders.",

As the appearance of Demons began to hurt her business, she decided to utilize anything she could, not just poisons. She sought help from her elementalist friend, who imbued the blowgun with the wind's blessing. This gave the weapon firepower equal to that of a magic cannon. After adding Requina's ultra-deadly, Demon-slaying poison to it, it became a powerful and deadly weapon capable of killing any living being.",

She made the poison, then named it Tear of Mr. Big Snake. The root extract of the Snake Mandrake causes excruciating pain. The agony is actually the gnawing away of the corrupted part of the soul. If one can endure it, their soul can be purified.",
        "A nasty fang of a Basilisk that only absorbs evil energy. Its poison is actually strong enough to melt souls. If the poison from the fang is mixed up with screechy grass, it could become a tremendous drug that no organism could survive. Requina's heart is beating hard with anticipation.",
        "Medicine made from boiling the powder of the seventieth rainbow and the tongue of the giant beast Kiselaton who can cross hell. It is full of brilliant colors. The moment one drinks it, it burns the insides, but it is said that whoever drinks it slowly dies in happiness.",

It is actually its pollen that contains neurotoxin. Requina grows the flowers in her garden for a stable supply of Kraseir pollen."
