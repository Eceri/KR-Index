    "story": "Reina von Stein was born the daughter of a noble family of the empire. Her free spirit and energetic personality seem to brighten up even those around her. She prefers a life of freedom as a mercenary over the suffocating life of an aristocrat. After working as a mercenary for a long time, and she's already lost all traces of her noble upbringing in her manners. Even as a child, she showed a natural talent with swords. Over the years, she developed her skills with a rapier, using a style that best suited her lithe physique. Recently, she turned down a strange contract. Ever since then, she has been feeling as if someone has been following and watching her.",

      "weapon": "The Stein family boasts a long lineage that dates back to the early days of the empire. The honor of the family, however, stems from the skills of its warriors, not its noble bloodline. Aria Stein was a legendary master of the blade. Remembered as one of the most skilled warriors in the history of the empire, she laid the foundation of the Stein family honor. Reina is her descendant. Aria's sword, Livatas, currently belongs to Reina. Light as a feather yet strong enough to withstand any strike, this sword helped Reina earn the nickname 'Flash.'",
      "soul": "To Reina's annoyance, many have attributed Reina's bladework solely to her sword, but it is actually the combination of Reina's long endeavor, and her innate ingenuity. Reina consciously trained to make her own unique moveset, different from that of her ancestors. Her mentor, while supporting Reina's perseverance, also gave Reina some advice out of worry.\n'Do not forget: You cannot go anywhere if you forget where your feet previously stood.'\nAfter some time has passed, whilst practising her sword skill, Reina came to the realization that she will never improve if she's only hellbent on surpassing Aria. Reina realized that without understanding Aria's feeling when she was wielding Livatis, her bladework will never be completed. After coming to an enlightenment, Reina's sword became a perfect flash. It was that moment when the soul of the great swordsman imbued into Livatis awakened newly inside Reina.",

        "A pair of mystical Ear Cuffs that raise the wearer's speed to the limit. Nyx gave it as a present to Reina, who kept telling him to open portals since she didn't care for the rigors of traveling. Reina wears this strange item in battle, and she looks like a pretty butterfly flying at lightning speed when she raises her sword.",
        "The ring that Reina received after defeating her master. It's too big, so she wears it on her thumb. It looks simple and ungainly, but the spirit of fighting is hidden within the rune letters engraved in the ring. Staring at the ring of her master makes her feel like she will be getting more work today.",
        "A honorable medal given to the fastest mercenary. It's said to be a keepsake from Hersz, the fastest warrior in the world. Wearing this medal will make the bearer's body feel lighter, and they'll be able to predict the opponent's movements.",
        "A pin that belongs to Reina's mother, a renowned leader of mercenaries in the Empire. She gave this pin to her daughter when she left to Orvel Kingdom all alone, hoping it would cast bad luck away. It can also be used as a weapon in case of emergency."
