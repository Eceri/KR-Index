She likes them so much that she always wears accessories resembling a bear's ears on her hat. So, she'll sometimes hunts tigers, but she'll never shoot a bear.

It was made small so that Rodina can use it easily, but it has the power to destroy anything.","A magazine about firearms being issued in the Empire. Issued regularly by Magos Le'Flamme, this firearms encyclopedia is Rodina's favorite magazine that contains various information about cutting-edge guns and weapons.
