During the Duchy's battle against the Demon Army, the Mountain Fortress went on a rampage when its seal was lifted. Under Jane's order, Theo set out to contain it. In his absence, powerful Demon officers attacked the royal palace. Theo returned to fight them despite heavy injury, but was unable to defeat them by himself. When the battle was over, he held the body of the princess in his arms and cried out from the ruins of the palace. Suddenly, a mysterious entity offered him a chance to defend his princess for all eternity. When he accepted, he fell into a deep slumber.",

Forging a spear from lightning was a tremendous task. But then again, Jin was no ordinary blacksmith. He smelted a huge mana stone infused with a red dragon's blood. He used this to contain the lightning before forging it into a spear. Aside from its chosen master, no person can touch this weapon. When its two pieces are combined, it lets out a tremendous flux of energy that resembles a dragon's roar.",
      "soul": "The soul of Legios had existed as a part of Transcendent of Lightning since the early ages. However, over the course of time, it gradually lost its power while being caged inside a pair of spears by a Red Dragon blacksmith.\nLegios decided to stay dormant until one worthy to carry the title of the Transcendent appeared. When Theo picked up Legios, it resonated strongly with Theo's soul, waking up from its long slumber. When Legios opened its eyes, Theo started feeling the presence of a great soul bound to the pair of spears. Despite Theo and Legios' effort to match the wavelengths, as Legios recovered more of its power, it started having detrimental effects on Theo's body. The alteration in Legios' wavelength due to a swing of emotion started to influence Theo's soul which became more and more sporadic. It was not until when he met his lady whom he lost 100 years ago that Theo's soul would become stabilized.\n\nThe soul of Theo and Legios started matching each other's wavelength, and together, they became truly worthy to be called as the new Transcendent.",

The sable's lustrous fur absorbs the kickback, significantly reducing the burden on Theo's body. Sereblos's fur works as a conductor that conveys Legios's electric signals to the entire body while protecting Theo's veins with holy energy, allowing him to fight without damaging his body.",
        "Called a thunderbolt from the sky. Legios is also called a holy beast. The power of Legios was so strong that when they made it into a weapon, the Republic of Gray couldn't contain all of its power. So the greatest piece was put in the Spear of Lightning, and the remaining pieces were put into different places. One of those pieces was put into God of Lightning's Necklace. It is said that anyone with this necklace can commune with the Spear of Lightning and get closer to the power of Legios.",
