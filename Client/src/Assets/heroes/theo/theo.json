Theo was the First Knight of the Republic and the wielder of the Lightning Legios. During the Duchy's battle against the Demon Army, the Mountain Fortress went on a rampage when its seal was lifted. Under Jane's order, Theo set out to contain it. In his absence, powerful Demon officers attacked the royal palace. Theo returned to fight them despite heavy injury, but was unable to defeat them by himself. When the battle was over, he held the body of the princess in his arms and cried out from the ruins of the palace. Suddenly, a mysterious entity offered him a chance to defend his princess for all eternity. When he accepted, he fell into a deep slumber.","itemIntroductions":{"weapon":"A spear said to have been forged from a bolt of lightning. Electricity constantly flows around this impressive spear that stands as tall as an average adult male. Forging a spear from lightning was a tremendous task. But then again, Jin was no ordinary blacksmith. He smelted a huge mana stone infused with a red dragon's blood. He used this to contain the lightning before forging it into a spear. Aside from its chosen master, no person can touch this weapon. When its two pieces are combined, it lets out a tremendous flux of energy that resembles a dragon's roar.","treasures":["A decoration that functions as a charm and is made with the fur of Sereblos, the holy sable. Legios's electric signals can push the body to its limit, but it is also physically taxing. The sable's lustrous fur absorbs the kickback, significantly reducing the burden on Theo's body. Sereblos's fur works as a conductor that conveys Legios's electric signals to the entire body while protecting Theo's veins with holy energy, allowing him to fight without damaging his body.","Called a thunderbolt from the sky. Legios is also called a holy beast. The power of Legios was so strong that when they made it into a weapon, the Republic of Gray couldn't contain all of its power. So the greatest piece was put in the Spear of Lightning, and the remaining pieces were put into different places. One of those pieces was put into God of Lightning's Necklace. It is said that anyone with this necklace can commune with the Spear of Lightning and get closer to the power of Legios.","Legacy of the fallen Republic of Gray. A treasure that a respected palace wizard of the Republic of Gray gave to the 1st Knight Theo, who received the Lightning Bolt Legios. The Lightning Essence that has the energy of the Lightning Bolt maximizes the effect of Lightning Explosion.","A funeral doll that Theo asked May to make.
