As the first type of the Project Evil Knights that were only made to kill, Chase was brought through a secretive contract with the empire to assassinate the sole successor to its throne, Scarlet. However, he went berserk for unknown reasons during a fight against Clause and Demia who were guarding Scarlet, and he abandoned his mission and left. He failed to kill Scarlet and disappeared, so the nobles who had commissioned the assassination found themselves in trouble. In the end, they hired another assassination group, the Laughing Mask, to have him killed. However, Scarlet already gave him a name, Chase, and let him stay by her side.",

Enhanced Human Type. 0 destroyed everything as soon as he woke up from the laboratory in order to find a weapon that could withstand his power. In the end, he tore out the horn of the monster Cannibal, which was known to have swallowed Arrogance out of the 7 sins. This horn went through the hands of the greatest blacksmiths of the empire and became the Blood Lancer Monolith. The flame of sin is burning inside the weapon, and whatever it pierces cannot be healed. The feeling of striking with this weapon is pleasurable enough to make him forget about the lingering attachment to his lost memory.",
      "soul": "Chase vaguely knew that the voice from nowhere that gave him the feeling of his heart tightening up and his heart rate increasing as if he had done something terribly wrong as well as the feeling of anxiety that crippled him to look only at the floor and nowhere else was guild and the longing for something, or someone. Whenever the unkown voice from a mysterious figure started whispering to whomever the message was inteded for, Chase would seal his ears with his fingers in the hopes of avoiding it, but the endless whispers slowly chipped away Chase's sanity. When Chase felt he was about to go completely insane, Cannibal's ego that was sleeping inside Monolith spoke to Chase.\nIt told Chase to succumb to its flame. Once he gives in, the voices will disappear.\nTrue to Cannibal's words, Chase could avoid hearing the voices while using Monolith, but he started relying on it more and more.\n\nUpon seeing Chase harnessing the flame that also damages its wielder, Scarlet scolded him heavily, but whenever the battle would take place, Chase, even after saying that he will try not to use Monolith, would mindlessly swing the Flame of Monolith.\nWorried that Chase may one day go berserk again, Scarlet requested Annette, the kingdom's revered technomagi, to investigate Chase and Monolith. Upon investigating, Annette found out that Monolith has become a vessel for the Soul of Cannibal, the Beast of Arrogance, and that Cannibal's Mana was affecting Chase's. Annette also told Scarlet that Cannibal has been feeding upon Chase's hidden anxiety and his longing for the ones he had forgotten, and that if Chase doesn't do something, Cannibal will one day consume Chase who left a scar on it. Nonetheless, Chase marches on with faith that he will not succumb to the flaming beast, with his comrades from the castle who provide endless support and encouragement.",

It doesn't really match his look, but he carries it all the time. Chase lost his memory and could only figure out who he was by the test subject code marked on his waist. The moment when someone called him by a name was when he finally found a goal in life. He decided to use his overflowing power to protect those who made him feel alive.",
        "Pauldron that Chase wears on one shoulder. It is made up of special ores that are hard to find in the Orbis Continent. It's light but extremely sturdy and unbreakable. An item that Demia managed to get for Chase, since Scarlet was fond of him. Demia didn't show it much, but she was intrigued by how Chase normally seemed so naive, and yet was so enthusiastic when it came to sparring. Demia watched him for a few days, and one day, patting his shoulder, she nonchalantly gave Chase the pauldron. She told him that fighting was important, but it was also important to take care of his own body.",
        "A life form sensor that was installed on Chase's waist. It looks like a small, oval capsule, and is designed to be inserted in the bodies of test subjects. Stamped on the capsule is the test subject code name, 'Type. 0,' and it contains a strange red material that stores information. This biometric sensor can store various tests and research information and logs the information of the test subject's location. If someone tries to take it out with force, it will self-detonate and kill the test subject to keep the experiments confidential. When Chase ripped this out of his waist, he broke it instantly. This small thing had been distorting his soul for too long. Then, he made a promise himself. He wanted to make those who drove him to misery tremble in fear, just from hearing his name."
