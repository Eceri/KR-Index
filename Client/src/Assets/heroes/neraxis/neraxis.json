    "story": "Black dragons are notorious for being the most arrogant and ill-tempered out of all dragons. They suffered greatly from the Demon War 100 years ago. Armarta went mad, Ashen Nox robbed them, and Draconics started hunting down dragons. Neraxis was one of the few black dragon that survived that day, and he has been working and plotting to realize his revenge.",

It holds the grudge and rage of black dragons that were killed during the Demon War. Neraxis threatened the dwarves to forge this special weapon for him. Then, he cursed and enchanted it with the grudge-filled souls of black dragons. Anyone who touches this weapon beside Neraxis will hear the raging roars of vengeful dragons.",
      "soul": "Dragons usually possess great strength, for they are the facilitators of the world.\nSo when such a dragon dies and becomes a soul, its strength is incomparable to other common souls because it is of a dragon's. Among them, the souls of the dragons contained within Acravita were especially odd, for these were the souls of the Black Dragons, the Proudest of them all. The souls became vengeful specters holdung strong grudges, imbuing Acravita with extraordinarily powerful resentment and damnation.\nAs the anger of the specters grew, resentment that was imbued to Acravita became heavier. Acravita eventually turned into a weapon that emitted energy of death that makes most beings tremble in fear, thus Neraxis' friends were worried about his safety. But Neraxis dismissed such worries by threatening the specters to stand down, claiming that Acravita was his and his only.\nEven though he is young, Neraxis is still a Black Dragon and he has more pride than any other Black Dragon. He even learned to slightly suppress his arrogance, as he did not want to follow Armarta's path. The fight between the young Black Dragon and the specters was intense, but Neraxis, who was more prepared, emerged as the victor.\nNow, the Black Dragon specters follow Neraxis, strengthening his lightning and eliminating his enemies.",
      "treasures": [
        "A magic amplifier that contains Black Lightning. It was made with the same materials used to craft Acravita. The dwarves were threatened by Neraxis to craft Acravita, and there were some materials left when they were finished. When the Dwarves asked Neraxis if they could keep the leftover material as a reward for crafting Acravita, he yanked their hair and told them to use it all. As a result, a cartridge containing Black Lightning was created.",
        "A hair accessory that Laias dropped while cleansing the waters corrupted by demons. Neraxis found it and kept it, but he still hasn't decided whether he'll give it back. It's not likely that Laias will get her lost hair accessory any time soon.",
        "Crafted with his own fang, this stake holds Neraxis's burning rage. When Neraxis attacks with the stake, the great energy, entangled with Neraxis's powers, swirls at the enemy at a terrifying speed. It is powerful enough to penetrate all things, and rip off the limbs of those who come near it.",
        "Neraxis stole this treasure from Armarta's repositorium. He wanted to have a stronger weapon than Acravita, and came to think of Armarta's repositorium. He went to Ashen Peak, the ruins south from Arrovina Shore, and snuck into the repositorium. On the way out, he had to confront Armarta, who was mad and crazy, but it was worth it as he got everything he wanted. Among the most precious ones were the 'Ashen Nova,' which makes a pair with 'Ashen Nox'. Its power can be compared to the heart of a Black Dragon."
