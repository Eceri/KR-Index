As one of the most talented wizards in the Tower of Sage, she has been granted the title of 'Purple' in recognition of her magic capability. She was raised in the Tower of Sage since childhood at her parents' request, but she still retains her dignity as an aristocrat. As a child, she never realized why her parents sent her away on her own, but now she understands their reasons. Now, she is back home, and is always attended by her handmaiden, who is like another member of the family to her.","itemIntroductions":{"weapon":"In the Tower of Sage, the title of Purple indicates the pinnacle of mana capacity. Aisha's seemingly endless mana was simply too much for regular means of output. For this reason, the von Daphnel family bought out all the best mana stones they could find, and took them to Annette, the best technomagi in Orvel Castle. Annette gladly agreed to take on this new project. Soon after, she created Mahitra, a beautiful umbrella befitting an aristocratic wizard of noble destiny.","treasures":["It is one of the items that the Tower of Sage granted with the title of Purple. It makes a set with the Ring of Mana. Purple represents an abundance of mana, and staying true to its name, the Flower of Purple has a crystal ball on it that boosts Aisha's mana and makes it explode. Since its power was too great, Priscilla made Aisha promise that she would only use it when absolutely necessary.","A sacred treasure passed down through generations of the von Daphnel family. It was a shaman tool to save mana in ancient times. After Aisha embedded the Noble Purple gem with her mana, its power came out. Now it shines brilliantly.","A ring that was given along with the title of Purple from the Tower of Sage. It is an artifact of witch Eucaletus, who lived in the Swamp of Wisdom. The power it displays depends on the owner's ability. For some, it could be a source of unlimited mana. It's perfect for Aisha, who uses powerful magic cannons.","A mysterious pendant found in ancient ruins. It was found in the tomb of someone known as the God of Wisdom and Ancient Knowledge. Aisha bought it at a shop in a back alley, fascinated by its purple jewel. After she realized that it reinforced her Mystic powers, she named it the Eyes of Truth and has been wearing it often."]}},"skins":[],"voice":{"actor":{"jp":"N/A","kr":"N/A","en":"N/A"},"lines":{"jp":[],"kr":[],"en":[]}}}
