It was another light that even the researchers who developed Arc Lumineir did not mention. Chrisha was taken by surprise, but she quickly regained her calmness and realiued that she is the only one who can draw this new-found power.\n'At last, i know for sure now that this is the weapon which only i can use. From now on, I will take you to all battles I fight, and use every single abilities you hold:'\nAfter then, Arc Lumineir was reborn as a weapon that releases massive light containing three elemental magic.",
