However, those who know a thing or two about clothing will never fail to bring up Yuria's name. Yuria, a tailor from Penteonia, always has two conditions that she sets when accepting requests. First, the client needs to allow Yuria to spend some time with the client so that she draws inspiration as to what kind of clothing she would make. Second, while she is with the client, the client must not lie or pretend to be something they are not. The first condition is for her sense of 'Foresight.' She needs to feel the client's thread of fate so she can express it through clothing. The second condition is mainly because she can sense the truth and finds lies disgusting. She doesn't want to make anything for anyone who won't be true. Her masterpieces, made with the fate she's read, are as valuable as starlight. Even the nobles would be envious of them.","itemIntroductions":{"weapon":"Yuria's favorite set of thread, needle, and scissors. Her masterpieces were all made with these tools. The thread with starlight from the night sky and the scissors and needle made from metal extracted from a meteorite give Yuria the power to read people's fate.","treasures":["The only shawl in the world that Yuria made with the starlight thread that she personally wove. Since she travels often, it was always important for Yuria to protect herself from the elements. Therefore, she decided to make something to keep her comfortable. The result was this shawl, one that provides temperature adjustment magic to the wearer. With this around her shoulders, storms or blizzards won't stop Yuria from traveling. The only downside is that it emits light even during the night. People who see her from afar mistake her for a fairy or a ghost and get frightened.","One of the legacies left by the fortune teller Lasiphil, a distant ancestor of Yuria. It's a set of 3 rings that have never lost their luster, even after the passage of time. They contain special powers that even Yuria cannot gauge. One of the books that Yuria's grandparents left said that when the time comes, the Foreseeing Eyes will shine their light, and that it will guide the prophet onto the right path.","One of the legacies left by the fortune teller Lasiphil, a distant ancestor of Yuria. Now kept in the back of Yuria's traveling wagon, this strange mirror covered with blue energy shows fate rather than reflections. Yuria has a rough understanding of what the mirror reveals, but even she cannot interpret it completely.","Strong but refreshing liquor of Penteonia. It is one of the best liquors in Orbis, and it's very valuable. It is Yuria's favorite, but she cannot get her hands on it easily as she travels frequently. So, she always returns to her home at least once a year to make a dress for the queen, and get a few bottles in return."]}},"skins":[],"voice":{"actor":{"jp":"N/A","kr":"N/A","en":"N/A"},"lines":{"jp":[],"kr":[],"en":[]}}}
